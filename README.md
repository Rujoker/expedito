# expedito
Unity 3D racing game for mobile platforms

This is an open-source version of Expedito game. The game is already released for Android devices in Google play. A the moment of open-source version release (4th November of 2021) both versions are identical in point of scripting and gameplay, but have minor differences in models (in open-source version we don't use 3rd party 3D assets). Further we're planing actively develop only the closed version. For open source wersion we are going to make only rare and minor updates.
